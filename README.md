# lotof.template.service

## Description
üöÄ This project is a microservice built using the NestJS framework. It serves as a central point for handling requests and routing them to appropriate microservices. The microservice also integrates with RabbitMQ for message brokering.

üîå With its modular architecture, the microservice enables seamless communication between different services, ensuring efficient and scalable application development.

üîí By leveraging the power of NestJS, developers can easily implement authentication, request validation, and other common functionalities in a declarative manner.

üêá The integration with RabbitMQ allows for reliable and asynchronous communication, enabling the microservice to handle high volumes of requests with ease.

üèóÔ∏è Whether you're building a monolithic application or a distributed system, this microservice provides a robust foundation for your project.
